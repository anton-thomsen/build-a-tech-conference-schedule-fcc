# Build a Tech Conference Schedule

## This is a tabble project within freecodecamp where I get to learn about the structure of a tabble and also the importances of Accessability within HTML document.

## Thoughts:
I thought this was a pretty nice project to do because I've done so much theory now on Accessability so it was nice to get coding again.

## Difficulty:
This was a super easy project was just nice to get the hand moving on the keyboard.
